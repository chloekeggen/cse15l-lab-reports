Go to this [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the latest VS Code. 

# Setting up environment

When finished downloading, open VS Code. In order to connect to remote servers, we need to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

1. Download the latest version, and once downloaded, open VS Code and create a new terminal at the top. Now, open the command palette using `CTRL` + `Shift` + `P` . 

2. Type "Select Default Profile"
3. Select "Git Bash"
4. Click on the + icon in the terminal window. 

Now Git Bash should be set up as the default terminal!
